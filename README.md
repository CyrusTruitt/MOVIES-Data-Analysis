# MOVIES Data Analysis


## Explanation

In this full project from scratch, I delved into a dataset on movies dataset, leveraging the power of Python and Pandas to perform in-depth analysis. From data cleaning and preprocessing to insightful visualizations, I uncovered patterns, trends, and key insights within the data.
This project showcases my skills in data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and visualization. Through meticulous data cleaning, preprocessing, and the creation of compelling visualizations, I unraveled intriguing patterns, trends, and invaluable insights within the cinematic data landscape.



### Steps Followed

- Step 1 : Imported libraries
- Step 2 : Imported movies.csv dataset
- Step 3 : Found how many columns and rows the dataset has and removed the unnecessary columns
- Step 4 : Drop NULL values from certain columns in the dataset and fill in NULL values with 0
- Step 5 : Created additional columns
    - profit
    - Roi

- Step 6: Histograms were created

- Step 7: Plotted the average of return on investment (Roi) over different release years

- Step 10: Created a scatter plot using the 'popularity' and  'vote_average' to check the dependency

Results show that vote average is not dependent on popularity

- Step 11: Split the values in 'genres' column  based on a delimiter (in this case, "|")

- Step 12: Checked the popularity of movies by genres

 Foreign has the lowest popularity with 35.24 and Drama is the most popular genre with 2815.43

 - Step 13: Checked the popularity of movies by months

 Avatar had the most profit out of the top 5 with 30.5% and Titanic had the least profit out of the top 5 with 14.6%

 - Step 16: Visualized the top 5 most popular production companies
